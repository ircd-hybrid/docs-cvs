  <para>Hybrid now supports <literal>gettext</literal> (provided in
        <application>GNU gettext/libintl</application>) to enable
        easier customization of messages, allow message files to be changed at
        runtime, and to provide pre-made translations.</para>

  <para>This document is split into two parts, using message files, and
        creating your own.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Using Provided or Pre-made Message Files</title>

    <para>There are a number of message files provided with <application>Hybrid
          7</application>.  These can be found in the source tree in
          <filename>messages/</filename> and
          <filename>messages/translations/</filename>.</para>

    <para>The ircd will install <filename>custom.po</filename> and
          <filename>ayb.po</filename> upon a <command>make install</command> on
          systems that <command>configure</command> finds a working
          <application>gettext</application> on.  These will be installed into
          the <literal>prefix</literal> directory under
          <filename>messages/</filename>.  To install the provided
          translations, you must change to the
          <filename>messages/translations</filename> directory in the source
          tree.  In this directory, you can run <command>make install</command>,
          and ircd will install all of the translated .po's into
          <filename>messages/</filename> in the <literal>prefix</literal>.
          There is no way at the present time to install a single .po file.
          </para>

    <para>These message files can be used in ircd once they are installed.  Try
          the installed message file with <command>/quote SET MSGLOCALE
          &lt;<replaceable>locale</replaceable>&gt;</command> first.  Locale
          will be '<literal>standard</literal>' for the
          <emphasis>plain</emphasis> messages that are Hybrid's default.
          '<literal>ayb</literal>' and '<literal>custom</literal>' are
          available on any installation that <command>configure</command> finds
          a working <application>gettext</application> for.  If the
          translations were installed, they can be set by
          '<literal>ircd-&lt;<replaceable>language</replaceable>&gt;</literal>',
          such as '<literal>ircd-danish</literal>' or
          '<literal>ircd-norwegian</literal>'.</para>

    <para>If the desired message file works without any issues, it can be set
          to be the default message file in the <filename>ircd.conf</filename>
          file.  Refer to <filename>example.conf</filename>'s documentation on
          the <literal>message_locale</literal> setting.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Creating Your Own Messages</title>

    <para>This process is a little more complicated.  The easiest way to start
          editing messages is to take a file such as
          <filename>custom.po</filename>, make a copy, and change whatever
          <emphasis>msgstr</emphasis> lines you wish.</para>

    <important>
      <para>Please do <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> ever change
            <emphasis>msgid</emphasis> lines, as this will prevent your
            customization from being used by gettext.</para>
    </important>

    <para>Once you have your customized message file ready, place it into
          <filename>messages/</filename> in the source tree, and open
          <filename>Makefile.in</filename> in a text editor.  Insert a line
          in the middle of the <literal>SRCS</literal> line, for example right
          after or right before <filename>custom.po</filename>.  Place the name
          of your customized message file on this line, followed by a
          <literal>\</literal>.</para>

    <para>Example:</para>

<screen>
SRCS = \
  custom.po \
  new.po \
  ayb.po
</screen>

    <para>Since these directories are under <command>configure's</command>
          control, any <filename>Makefile</filename> changes must be done to
          <filename>Makefile.in</filename>.   This also requires
          <command>configure</command> to be rerun with at minimum the prefix
          option.</para>

    <para>You will now be able to cd into <filename>messages/</filename> and
          run <command>make install</command>.</para>

    <para>There is always a chance of creating a syntax error, but the benefit
          to using <application>gettext</application> over <application>Hybrid
          6</application>'s <filename>src/messages_cust.tab</filename> is that
          syntax errors will not break the compile of the server, just of the
          message file.</para>

    <para>Creating a message file from scratch is relatively simple as well.
          cd into <filename>messages/</filename> and run <command>./create_po
          &lt;<replaceable>name</replaceable>&gt;.po</command>.  This command
          will generate a blank message file, listing all of the ircd default
          message ID's, with no replacements.  Any message that you wish to
          keep the same as the ircd defaults, you will leave the msgstr set to
          <literal>""</literal>.  Any message that you wish to change requires
          you to write a complete replacement for in msgstr.  Again, please do
          <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> change the msgid.  The replacement string
          must contain the same number of <literal>%</literal> arguments, and
          the arguments must be kept in the same order.</para>

    <para>Once your message file is complete, you must put it into
          <filename>Makefile.in</filename> as described above.  You must then
          rerun <command>configure</command> as described above.  If
          the default (standard locale) messages ever change in Hybrid, your
          file can be updated with the <command>make mrupdate</command> command
          in the <filename>messages/</filename> directory.  Be sure and have a
          backup of your old one first, as this sometimes will give unusual
          entries in the .po files.  Before attempting to use the updated
          message file, you must read through the customized file and be sure
          that it is correct.</para>

    <para>If you create a translation for a new language, or an update to an
          existing translation, please do not hesitate in sending the .po file
          to the <literal>Hybrid team</literal>.  Providing a translation will
          be a way that nearly anyone who knows multiple languages to
          contribute to ircd, and get their name in the translation credits.
