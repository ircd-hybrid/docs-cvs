    <abstract>
      <para>In an effort to reduce the damage caused to a network by a
            <emphasis>hacked</emphasis> O-line, Hybrid supports an
            <application>OpenSSL</application> based challenge-response
            system.  This new system allows the admin to remove all oper block
            passwords from the conf file.  Authentication is done through a
            public/private key.</para>
    </abstract>

  <sect1>
    <title>Requirements</title>

    <para>The <command>ircd</command> must be compiled with the
          <option>--enable-openssl</option> option to <command>configure
          </command>.</para>

    <para><literal>oper {}</literal> blocks should not have
          <emphasis>normal</emphasis> passwords, but should contain the
          the name of the private key file.  However it is possible for the
          user to use both challenge and normal passwords, but this would
          defeat the purpose of the challenge system.</para>

    <para><filename>m_challenge.so</filename> must be loaded.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Process</title>

    <para>Each oper should have a private key file and a public key file.
          The keys can be generated with the <command>mkkeypair</command>
          utility provided in <filename>tools/</filename>.  The keys are
          compatible with cryptlink keys.</para>

    <para>The oper keeps their private key file in a safe place, and gives
          their public key file to their admin(s).</para>

    <para>The admin will place an entry for the public key file into a field
          called <literal>rsa_public_key_file</literal> of each oper's
          <literal>oper {}</literal> block in the conf file.</para>

    <para>The oper wishes to obtain their operator status, and issues the
          <command>CHALLENGE</command> command.</para>

    <para>The server will print out a long hexadecimal string, that needs to
          be fed to the <command>respond</command> utility provided in
          <filename>tools/rsa_respond</filename>.</para>

    <para>The <command>respond</command> program will generate an answer that
          is fed back to the <command>CHALLENGE</command> command.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Generating the Key Files</title>

    <para>The keys can be generated with the <command>openssl</command>
          command as follows:</para>

    <screen>
      <userinput>openssl genrsa -des3 -out rsa.key 1024</userinput>
      <userinput>openssl rsa -in rsa.key -pubout -out rsa.pub</userinput>
    </screen>

    <para>It is <emphasis>highly recommended</emphasis> that you set a
          password on your private key.</para>

    <para>A key pair can also be generated with the
          <command>tools/mkkeypair</command> utility.</para>

    <para>There is a tool called <command>respond</command> in
          <filename>tools/rsa_respond</filename> in the
          <application>Hybrid</application> source tree.  This program can
          be easily distributed to each oper.</para>

    <para>A script is included in the <filename>Makefile</filename> to create
          a distributable tar file from the source tree.  Issue
          <userinput>make rsa_respond</userinput> from the root of the source
          tree to create the <filename>rsa_respond.tar.gz</filename> archive.
          This can then be distributed to all of the server operators.  Look
          at the <filename>README</filename> in the tar archive for more
          detailed instructions.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Using CHALLENGE and respond</title>

    <para>The administrator of the server you oper on should remove the
          password in your <literal>oper {}</literal> block and replace it
          with an entry for your public key, so that <command>/oper</command>
          will be disabled.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The public key is a VERY long string.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The oper will issue <command>/challenge
          <replaceable>oper_nick</replaceable></command>, and see something
          like below:</para>

    <note>
      <para>The challenge is all on one line.</para>
    </note>

    <note>
      <para>With some clients, the oper will have to issue <command>/quote
            CHALLENGE</command> instead of <command>/challenge</command>.
            </para>
    </note>

    <para>The oper will then have to feed that challenge to the
          <command>respond</command> program.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <para>The respond utility's syntax is:</para>

      <!-- Unfortunately, screen cares about whitespace -->

      <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>./respond</command> <userinput>private_key_file</userinput> <userinput>challenge_from_server</userinput>

       <note>
         <para>The challenge parameter must be on one line.</para>
       </note>
    </sidebar>

    <para>The keyphase must be entered properly to get the response.  The
          bottom line is the response that must be sent back to the
          server.</para>

    <para>The oper will issue the following command in order to obtain operator
          status:</para>

    <para><command>/challenge
          +6B882932DD00F86123869E401F7334B9B0D0018A60F1DE244E90E47246AA87C7
          </command></para>

    <note>
      <para>The '+' is needed</para>
    </note>

    <para>If successful, the oper will obtain operator status on the
          server.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Benefits</title>

    <para>The greatest benefit of using the challenge/response system is
          that there are no passwords sent over the network in plaintext.
          There are also no credentials left on the server side, as only
          public keys are kept in the conf.  The use of public/private key
          encryption provides far greater security over having a single
          password, and may (if the key is kept secure, and has a good
          passphrase) virtually eliminate hacked O-lines.</para>
